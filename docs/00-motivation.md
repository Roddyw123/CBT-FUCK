# CBT-FUCK
CBT-FUCK is a hobbyist bidirectional C ↔ Brainfuck transpiler built with a focus on simplicity, correctness, and extensibility. It is a complete rewrite of CBT, another bidrectional C ↔ Brainfuck transpiler built solely on C.

Motivated by unfamiliar compilation targets and deliberately hostile semantics, this project is far from practical, and is instead defined by a pursuit of challenge, experimentation, and understanding how far low-level translation can be pushed.
